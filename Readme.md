# M-Files COM API Extensions (Community)

_Please note that this library is provided "as-is" and with no warranty, explicit or otherwise. You should ensure that the functionality meets your requirements, and thoroughly test them, prior to using in any production scenarios._

The following helper library is a community-driven set of functionality that extends the base M-Files COM API.  This library is open-source and not directly supported by M-Files.  Contributions are accepted according to our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Nuget package

This library is available [via nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MFilesAPI.Extensions/).  The simplest way to get started with this library is to add the `MFilesAPI.Extensions` package to your existing .NET application.  .NET Framework 4.6 (and higher) and .NET Standard 2.0 runtimes are supported.

The [current release](https://github.com/M-Files/COMAPI.Extensions.Community/tree/master/current-release) is also published alongside the source code.
